# Perseus Scripts

These are cross-platform scripts written in Rust, and designed to be executed with [`rust-script`](https://github.com/fornwall/rust-script). These are intended primarily for complex tasks involving manipulating files in the repository, rather than command-line tasks that could easily be defined with Bonnie. Note that Bonnie is used as a frontend over all the scripts in this directory.

Note that these are all designed to be executed from the root of the project.
