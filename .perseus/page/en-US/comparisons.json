However, the more ReactJS-like style of Yew's syntax may be appreciated by developers who are used to working with React, while Sycamore (which underlies Perseus) uses a more SolidJS-like approach (which, since it doesn't have a virtual DOM, is faster).\"}},\"perseus_comparison\":{\"name\":\"Perseus\",\"supports_ssg\":\"full\",\"supports_ssr\":\"full\",\"supports_ssr_ssg_same_page\":\"full\",\"supports_i18n\":\"full\",\"supports_incremental\":\"full\",\"supports_revalidation\":\"full\",\"inbuilt_cli\":\"full\",\"inbuilt_routing\":\"full\",\"supports_shell\":\"full\",\"supports_deployment\":\"full\",\"supports_exporting\":\"full\",\"language\":\"Rust\",\"homepage_lighthouse_desktop\":100,\"homepage_lighthouse_mobile\":95,\"text\":\"\"}}","head":"<title>Comparisons to Other Frameworks | Perseus</title>"}
