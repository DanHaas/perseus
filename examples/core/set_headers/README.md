# Header Setting Example

This examples shows how to set headers in Perseus based on your pages' states. This was originally part of the `basic` example, but it was refactored to be separate for clarity. Note that you'll need to use `perseus serve` to see the effects of custom headers.

*Note: the tests of this example use `ureq` to verify the presence of the necessary server, but they use the usual test boilerplate to make sure that the server has actually been spawned.*
