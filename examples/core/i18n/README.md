# Internationalization Example

This example shows a very basic Perseus app using internationalization (abbreviated *i18n*) in three languages: English, French, and Spanish. This shows how to use translations, access them, and how to insert variables into them.

Note that this i18n in this example uses the [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org) integration.
