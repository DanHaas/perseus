# Unreactive Example

This example shows you how to use the old `#[template(...)]` macro that doesn't make use of Perseus' reactive state platform. There are very few cases in which you'll actually use this, as it doesn't play well with more modern features like HSR and global state, so this example is mostly for legacy reference.
