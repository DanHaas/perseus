# Router State Example

This example shows how to use listen to the router's state to anticipate page load events to create custom loaders and the like. It's a rudimentary example that shows the basics, but it should suffice for most purposes when combined with other resources on how to create the kinds of loaders you want. If you'd like to contribute a new example that builds on this to create a full loader, please open a PR!
