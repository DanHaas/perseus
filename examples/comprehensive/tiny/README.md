# Tiny Example

This exmaple shows the smallest possible and meaningful Perseus app, a simple 'Hello World!' app. This is considered a comprehensive example because it doesn't show a particular feature of Perseus, nor does it demonstrate how to do a common task. The structure of this example isn't likely to be used anywhere in the real world (your templates and error pages would nearly alwasy be in separate files), but it serves as a great way of showing the absolute basics of Perseus and getting new users to hit the ground running.
